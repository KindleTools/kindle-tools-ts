# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code.

## How to use

When you make changes that should be released, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose a semver bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a summary of changes

## Releasing

When ready to release:

```bash
pnpm version    # Updates versions and generates CHANGELOG
pnpm release    # Builds and publishes to npm
```
